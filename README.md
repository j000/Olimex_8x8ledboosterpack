Olimex_8x8ledboosterpack
========================

Hello world for Olimex 8x8 LED boosterpack sitting on MSP430 Launchpad (currently using MSP430G2452).

-----
This was original Olimex example from [https://www.olimex.com/Products/MSP430/Booster/MSP430-LED8x8-B00STERPACK/]().

ATM it's going c++ from c.
 And hopefully it will still work.

Next step will be going away from watchdog to timer and/or interrupts.

-----

I hope with time it will evolve into easy to use library with some pretty functions. We'll see.
